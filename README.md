# Customer Service Chatbot

A project that I made to explore chatbots and they function within a web app. This application allows you to chat with a customer service chatbot

# Setup & Start
1. Install dependencies: npm install
2. Create a database called `chatbot`
3. A few secret variables need to be defined before using the app. Make a .env file on the project's root folder and add the following:
    1. JWT="budgetlyApp"
    2. SEED_USER_PASS="budgetlyApp"
    3. YAHOO_FINANCE_API="Can get one for free from: https://www.yahoofinanceapi.com/"
4. Sync and seed your database by running npm run seed
5. Use npm run start:dev to start a local server (on port 8080)
